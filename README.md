## Overview of Project

### Purpose

  The purpose of this analysis is to show the difference between the campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  How I preformed my analysis using images and links to code is using it by example and applying these methods to create the data needed to solve the problems I came across.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  Throughout this challenge it was rather smooth until it came time to use the COUNTIFS function. Although this function is very helpful, I had a few difficulties when applying the formula to the database simply because I did not know how to use it. I had many trials and errors trying to figure it out, even watch the video several times and had to walk away from my computer a few times, but I did not give up. I was determined to get it right. Eventually I watched the video again and noticed the formula that was being used so I tweaked and apply the formula and I got it right. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  Two conclusions I am able to draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date is for the month of May it is the highest and most successful month and for the month of October no one has canceled.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

  What I concluded about the Outcomes based on Goals is no one has canceled, so the percentage is zero all the way through.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

  Some limitations of this dataset are it is only based on one year worth of data, and it is only limited to one subcategory, if it was applied to multiple subcategories the results would be different. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

  Other possible table or graphs that we could create is a bar graph. A bar graph is a great visual to look at data and see the results of the information gathered.
